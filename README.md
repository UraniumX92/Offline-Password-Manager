# Offline Password Manager 

**Version : 1.0**

## About :
This is an offline Password Manager, which encrypts the passwords and stores it in the `.json` files and retrieves
the passwords and decrypts the encrypted password, and shows to user.
> **Note :** `.json` files are automatically generated when the program starts for the first time.
 
>***
## Encryption :
The Encryption done to protect the passwords from being readable by someone who opens the `.json` file is similar to that of [Encryptor I made](https://github.com/UraniumX92/Encryptor "Link to the GitHub Repository of Encryptor that I made.") a few days ago from now.

The Key is randomly generated and stored in a `.json` file.

But only the program knows how to handle and use the key. Because the key visible in `.json` file is not the actual key.

Even if someone uses the key from `.json` file, They wouldn't be able to extract the passwords. As the key visible is not the actual key.
